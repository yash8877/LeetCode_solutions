Problem Statement
Food Corner home delivers vegetarian and non-vegetarian meals to its customers based on the order.

A vegetarian combo costs $12 per plate and a non-vegetarian combo costs $15 per plate. Apart from the cost per plate of food, customers are also charged for home delivery based on the distance in kms from the restaurant to the delivery point. The delivery charges are as mentioned below:
first 3km =0$
next 3km=$1
remaining km 2$
Given the type of food, quantity (no. of plates) and the distance in kms from the restaurant to the delivery point, implement a program to calculate the final bill amount to be paid by a customer.

The below information must be used to check the validity of the data provided by the customer: 

Type of food must be 'V' for vegetarian and 'N' for non-vegetarian.

Distance in kms must be greater than 0.

Quantity ordered should be minimum 1.

If any of the input is invalid, the bill amount should be displayed as -1.

Problem Statement
The Metro Bank provides various types of loans such as car loans, business loans and house loans to its account holders, i.e., customers.

Implement a program to determine the eligible loan amount and the EMI that the bank can provide to its customers based on their salary and the loan type they expect to avail.

The values required for determining the eligible loan amount and the EMI are:

account number of the customer
account balance of the customer
salary of the customer
loan type 
expected loan amount
expected no. of EMIs

The following validations should be performed:
The account number should be of 4 digits and its first digit should be 1

The customer should have a minimum balance of $1000 in the account

Display appropriate error messages if the validations fail.

If the validations pass, determine whether the bank would provide the loan or not. 

The bank would provide the loan, only if the loan amount and the number of EMIs expected by the customer is less than or equal to the loan amount and the number of EMIs decided by the bank respectively. The bank decides the eligible loan amount = 50,0000 and the number of EMIs = 36 based on the below table.



Display the account number, eligible and requested loan amount and the number of EMIs if the bank provides the loan.

Display an appropriate message if the bank does not provide the loan.

You are given an array nums consisting of positive integers.

Return the total frequencies of elements in nums such that those elements all have the maximum frequency.

The frequency of an element is the number of occurrences of that element in the array.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,2,3,1,4]
Output: 4
Explanation: The elements 1 and 2 have a frequency of 2 which is the maximum frequency in the array.
So the number of elements in the array with maximum frequency is 4.
Example 2:

Input: nums = {1,2,3,4,5}
Output: 5
Explanation: All elements of the array have a frequency of 1 which is the maximum.
So the number of elements in the array with maximum frequency is 5.
